Consider setting $\Omega = 1$ and varying the other Hamiltonian parameters independently :

$$
L = [5, 6, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20]
$$
$$
\delta / \Omega = [-0.36, -0.13, 0.93, 1.05, 1.17, 1.29, 1.52, 1.76, 2.94, 3.17]
$$
$$
R_b / a = [1.05, 1.15, 1.3]
$$
$$
\beta \Omega    = [0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, 64]
$$
There are a total of `8 x 10 x 3 x 9 = 2160` configurations.
